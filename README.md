</div>

This repository contains a group of BentoML example projects, showing you how to serve and deploy open-source LLMs using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), a fast serving framework for LLMs and VLMs.

ðŸ’¡ You can use these examples as bases for advanced code customization. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI-compatible endpoints without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).

See [here](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/examples/overview.html) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

The following is an example of serving one of the LLMs in this repository: Llama 3.1 8B.

## Prerequisites

- You have gained access to Llama 3.1 8B on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).
- If you want to test the Service locally, we recommend you use an Nvidia GPU with at least 16G VRAM.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoSGLang.git
cd BentoSGLang/llama3.1-8b-instruct

# Recommend Python 3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt

export HF_TOEKN=<your-api-key>
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. RunÂ `bentomlÂ serve`Â in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
$ bentoml serve .

2024-11-12T02:47:06+0000 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:SGL" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
2024-11-12T02:49:31+0000 [INFO] [entry_service:bentosglang-llama3.1-8b-instruct-service:1] Service bentosglang-llama3.1-8b-instruct-service initialized
```

The server is now active atÂ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

<summary>Python client</summary>

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    response_generator = client.generate(
        prompt="Explain superconductors in plain English",
        max_tokens=1024
    )
    for response in response_generator:
        print(response, end='')
```

</details>

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html).

```bash
bentoml cloud login
```

Create a BentoCloud secret to store the required environment variable and reference it for deployment.

```bash
bentoml secret create huggingface HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN

bentoml deploy . --secret huggingface
```

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).
